# Benchmark Metrics Analysis

Analysis of the benchmarks produced by `cmd/BenchmarkMain.cpp`. The benchmark
harness exercises the real `StorageClient` API across an erasure-parameter sweep
and exports per-operation metrics as CSV (see
[ADR-0007](../adr/0007-metrics-collector.md)).

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `metrics_utils.py` | Shared CSV loading, validation and plotting helpers. |
| `01_performance.ipynb` | Latency (phase breakdown) and storage-overhead analysis. |
| `02_reliability.ipynb` | Recovery success rate and repair behaviour. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for the notebooks. |
| `sample_results.csv` | Synthetic fallback so notebooks run without a cluster. |

## CSV schema

Produced by `MetricsCollector::export_csv`:

```
operation, k, m, shard_size, object_size, failed_nodes, total_nodes,
crypto_ms, transport_ms, total_ms, success, storage_overhead
```

`operation` is one of `PUT`, `GET`, `REPAIR`. `storage_overhead` is populated on
`PUT`; `failed_nodes` is populated on `REPAIR`.

## Generating the data

The benchmark requires a running integration cluster (PostgreSQL + storage
nodes), the same as the integration tests:

```bash
cd pqdos-dev
./scripts/setup-integration.sh
./build/Release/benchmark        # writes docs/metrics/benchmark_results.csv
./scripts/teardown-integration.sh
```

Override the output path or DB connection via `BENCHMARK_CSV_PATH` and
`BENCHMARK_METADATA_CONN`.

If `benchmark_results.csv` is absent, the notebooks fall back to
`sample_results.csv` so they can still be executed.

## Running the notebooks

```bash
cd pqdos-dev/docs/metrics
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook        # open 01_performance.ipynb / 02_reliability.ipynb
```

## Shutdown and cleanup

After working with the notebooks, stop Jupyter with `Ctrl + C`, then run:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf .venv
```

This removes the virtual environment and all packages installed from
`requirements.txt`. Nothing is installed system-wide. The environment can be
recreated at any time.
